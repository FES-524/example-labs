The repository provides examples of how to create your lab write-ups such that I can view and provide feedback within GitHub Classroom.

edit from somewhere else

The first few lines of your `.Rmd` file will be a YAML. They should look something like this:

```{html}
---
title: "Title"
author: "Your name"
date: "the date"
output: github_document
---
```

There are many other options you can add to your YAML, but these are the basics. Some others that I use quite often are `toc: true` to add a table of contents and `urlcolor: cyan` to differentiate hyperlinks by coloring them light blue. You can also use `output: pdf_document`, which I can view in GitHub Classroom, but you will need a TeX installation for that to work.

You can now complete your writeup in between "chunks" of code (see the `README.Rmd` and `example_lab_report.Rmd`).

# Examples

Below are a bunch of examples of things you can add to your report. The code for creating them can be found in `README.Rmd`.

## Plots


```{r plotname, fig.height=3, fig.width=3, fig.cap="Example plot."}
library(tidyverse)

# create a plot
  ggplot(data = pressure, aes(x = temperature, y = pressure)) +
    geom_point() +
    theme_classic() +
    geom_smooth(se = F)
```

You can reference a plot, such as Figure \@ref(fig:plotname), using the syntax `\@ref(fig:plotname)` inside the markdown text if you install the `bookdown` R package and include the following in the YAML:

```{html}
---
output:
  bookdown::github_document2
---
```

## Tables

Tables can be rendered straight from dataframes using the `kableExtra` package.

```{r}
library(kableExtra)
# pass a few lines of a dataframe to kable
  head(pressure) %>%
    kable(
      caption = "An example table.",
      label = "eg-tab"
    ) %>%
    kable_classic(full_width = FALSE) %>%
    kable_styling(
      bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"), full_width = FALSE
    )

```

Tables such as Table \@ref(tab:eg-tab) can also be referred to in the text by referencing the label supplied to the `label` argument using the syntax `\@ref(tab:label)`. 

**Note**: You may need to add `always_allow_html: true` to the YAML to get some tables generated using `kableExtra` to render in a `github_document`.

## Hiding some R code

You can always supply the option `echo=FALSE` to a code chunk if you do not want it to render. Keep your writeups short and to the point. Don't include any extraneous information or R code!

## Rendering results of r-code inline

If you want to add a value, for example the estimate of a parameter in a statistical model, to the report, you can do so using the syntax below, replacing `rcode` with some code that would print the result to the standard out.

```{html eval=FALSE}
`r rcode`
```


## Other

### Images

`![](path-to-image)`

### Hyperlinks

`[text to disply](url)`

### Math

You can add math symbols using LaTeX syntax. For example,

```{}
$$e^{i\pi} = -1$$
```

will render as a display equation like so:

$$e^{i\pi} = -1$$
while

```{}
$e^{ix} = \cos(x) + i \sin(x)$
```

will render inline like so: $e^{ix} = \cos(x) + i \sin(x)$
